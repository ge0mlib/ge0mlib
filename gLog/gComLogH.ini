===============Ini-file Description=======================
Line01: Com1 Name. Example: \\.\COM212
Line02: OutputCom2 Name. Example: \\.\COM213
        If the first symbol is not '\' then OutputCom2 is not used.
Line03: BaudRate ByteSize Parity StopBits. Example: 9600 8 0 0
        Used for Com1 and OutputCom2 configuration.
        BaudRate: 110,300,600,1200,2400,4800,9600,14400,19200,14400,19200,38400,57600,115200,128000,256000.
        Parity: NOPARITY==0;ODDPARITY==1;EVENPARITY==2;MARKPARITY==3;SPACEPARITY==4.
        StopBits: ONESTOPBIT==0;ONE5STOPBITS==1;TWOSTOPBITS==2.
Line04: End Of Line symbol code; End Of Line time in milliseconds (if Line10~='P') or 0,1 microseconds (if Line10=='P'). Example: 10 100
Line05: RAM-buffer size (when buffer full the data moved to log-file). Example: 1024
Line06: Log-file’s name last symbols (extension as a particular case). Example1: .log Example2: hello_world.txt
Line07: Autobreak code for log-file. 'H'- new file will be created every hour; 'D'- every day; another- no autobreak. Example: H
Line08: LeftDelimiter,RightDelimiter. Example1:<> Example2:0,
Line09: Com1 and OutputCom2 DTR and RTS state. Example1:1111 (set RTS1, set DTR1, set RTS2, set DTR2) Example2:0000 (clr RTS1, clr DTR1, clr RTS2, clr DTR2) Example3:9999 (will not manage RTS/DTR)
Line10: TimeMode. If set 'P' than 12th chars length "time in 0.1 microsecond" write to file ('GetSystemTimePreciseAsFileTime' function is used to get time); 
        else 8th symbols "time in 0.1 millisecond" write to file ('Now' function is used to get time).

======================Keys=================================
ESC            - Hard Exit;
q+shift        - Soft Exit (wail End Of Line symbol from Com);
c+shift        - Break log-file and start new.
===================Features================================
Program will open (search) ini-file in current directory with the name same exe-file.
You can rename exe-file and ini-file with the same name. So, the several program copy can be start from one directory.
Program write log-files in current directory with 'time-and-data'; ith file name is created as: YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS + string from ini-file's Line05.
Program create new file every hour or every day (Line07). You can create new file any time, using 'C' key.
If program wait data longer than End Of Line time (Line03), it is break message without End Of Line symbol and start new message waiting.
Program prints each 'com-string' on the screen, when End Of Line symbol was spent.
When program move RAM buffer to file, it print all chars from buffer to screen (not depend from End Of Line symbol).
Program used WaitCommEvent function but used OverLap to write RAM-buffer (Line05) to file.
!!!!!! Warning: TimeMode 'P' in 0,1 microsecond, presented UTC-time; TimeMode in millisecond presented LocalTime. Please correct the time zone in accordance your aim.
